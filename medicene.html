	  <h3>Applications Of Biotechnology In Medicine
</h3>
													
      <p>
Biotechnology and DNA technology could be considered synonymous. So much of biotechnology is DNA based. Remember that biotechnology is technology based on biological applications. Since the completion of the human genome project, the data produced from the project and the tools and technologies associated with the project have led to numerous biotechnology applications.

Recombinant Insulin

In the 1920s, there was no known way to produce insulin, which was needed by people to remove excess sugar from the bloodstream. People with diabetes either lack insulin, produce low levels of insulin, or are resistant to insulin, and thus they may need external insulin to control blood glucose levels. This problem was solved, at least temporarily, when it was found that insulin from a pigâ€™s pancreas could be used in humans. This method was the primary solution for diabetes until recently. The problem with insulin from pigs was that there were not enough pigs to provide the quantities of insulin needed. Scientists needed to devise another way to produce insulin. This led to one of the biggest breakthroughs in recombinant DNA technology: the cloning of the human insulin gene.
