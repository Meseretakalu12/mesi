    <h3><u>Introduction of Biotechnology</u></h3>
          <p>
          Biotechnology is technology that utilizes biological systems, living organisms or parts of this to develop or create different products.Brewing and baking bread are examples 
          of processes that fall within the concept of biotechnology (use of yeast (= living organism) to produce the desired product). Such traditional processes usually utilize the 
          living organisms in their natural form (or further developed by breeding), while the more modern form of biotechnology will generally involvea more advanced modification of 
          the biological system or organism.With the development of genetic engineering in the 1970s, research in biotechnology (and other related areas such as medicine, biology etc.) 
          developed rapidly because of the new possibility to make changes in the organisms' genetic material (DNA).
          Today, biotechnology covers many different disciplines (eg. genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, etc.). New technologies and products are developed every year within the
          areas of eg. medicine (development of new medicines and therapies), agriculture (development of genetically modified plants, biofuels, biological treatment) or industrial 
          biotechnology (production of chemicals, paper, textiles and food.
